## 0.12.4
### Pulsar?
I've always used themes like Nucleus, Pristine, and Isotope. Staple themes of my development experience, and staple experiences that made Atom one of my favorite editors to work in. I couldn't decide fully on a theme I wanted to make work for Pulsar, mostly for personal usage; and eventually settled on Nucleus for it's cleanliness and straightforward feel. I'll keep this repo updated with fixes as they come around, but my main focus will always be to stay true to the original Nucleus feel, palatte, and experience. More than likely will not get any other "large" updates, but I can guarantee fully compatability with Pulsar going forward. o/

Actual changelog:
- Minor edits to scrollbars and tab side buttons fixing any inconsistencies
